# TTP'S

## What are TTP's?
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP's) represent how threat agents (the adversary) actually execute and manage their attacks. Specifically, "TTP's are patterns of activites or methods associated with a _specific_ threat actor or group of threat actors". In short, they categorize the attack by way of identifying the most probable actor, including related attacks, possible sources or vectors, what systems are most likely to be compromised, and how to defend against these known threat agent TTP's. 
	
TTP's directly help to attribute to a foreign nation-state adversary, in addition to common vectors of attack, i.e emails with a zero-day exploit.
