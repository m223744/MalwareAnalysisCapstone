# AUTOMATED STATIC ANALYSIS OF MALWARE 

## Students:
	Dylan Larkin, m223744, m223744@usna.edu
	Greg Nelson, m224788, m224788@usna.edu
	Eric Tymoshenko, m226678, m226678@usna.edu 

## Faculty Mentors
	LCDR Slack --  
	Dr. Brown -- 
	
## Supplies
	Raspberry Pi 4b 4GB used as a web server to host our automated scripts and maintain a database of collected binaries. 
	
## End-Goal
	Provide an automated static malware analysis toolkit that analysis binaries and is able to categorize them based off of their static properties. This tool will be used via website hosted on the Raspberry Pi 4 and store them in a MySQL database for later analysis and categorization.

## Timeline  
* Started 12OCT20
	* Began compiling resources, acquired our faculty mentors, and established our "draft goal" of what we seek to accomplish. 

# TTP'S

### What are TTP's?
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP's) represent how threat agents (the adversary) actually execute and manage their attacks. Specifically, "TTP's are patterns of activites or methods associated with a _specific_ threat actor or group of threat actors". In short, they categorize the attack by way of identifying the most probable actor, including related attacks, possible sources or vectors, what systems are most likely to be compromised, and how to defend against these known threat agent TTP's. 
	
TTP's directly help to attribute to a foreign nation-state adversary, in addition to common vectors of attack, i.e emails with a zero-day exploit. 

# Malware 

### Categories of Malware 
*As defined in the book Practical Malware Analysis by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski*

* Backdoor
	* Installs itself onto a computer to allow attacker access with little or no authentication which allows the attacker to execute commands on the local system. 

* Botnet 
	* Allows attacker access to the system, but all computers infected with the same botnet receive the same commands from a single Command and Control (C&C) server.
	
* Downloader 
	* Malicious code that exists only to download other malicious code, and are often installed when the attacker first gains access to a system. 
	
* Information-stealing malware
	* Collects information from a victim's computer and sends it to the attacker; sniffers, password hash grabbers, keyloggers, etc.
	
* Launcher
	* Used to launch other malicious programs, but often use nontraditional techniques to launch other malicious programs in order to ensure stealthy operations. 
	
* Rootkit
	* Designed to conceal the existence of other code, which means that it is often paired with other malware in order to make the code difficult for the victim to detect.
	
* Scareware 
	* Designed to frighten the user into thinking that there is something wrong with their computer, and that they would have to buy something in order to have it removed.

* Spam-sending Malware 
	* Uses the victim machine to send spam; generates income for attackers by selling spam-sending services. 
	
* Worm or Virus
	* Copies itself and infects additional computers.
