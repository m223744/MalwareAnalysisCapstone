# AUTOMATED STATIC ANALYSIS OF MALWARE

## Students:
	Dylan Larkin, m223744, m223744@usna.edu
	Greg Nelson, m224788, m224788@usna.edu
	Eric Tymoshenko, m226678, m226678@usna.edu

## Faculty Mentors
	LCDR Andrew Slack, slack@usna.edu
	Dr. Dane Brown, dabrown@usna.edu

## Supplies
Raspberry Pi 4b 4GB used as a web server to host our automated scripts and maintain a database of collected binaries.

## End-Goal
Provide an automated static malware analysis toolkit using **_OPEN-SOURCE_** software and python libraries that will analyize binaries and is able to categorize them based off of their static properties to determine whether or not they are malicious. This tool will be used via website hosted on the Raspberry Pi 4 and potentially store analysis results in a MySQL database for later analysis and categorization, but will also be able to be used via command line for quick static analysis with no database storage.

## Timeline  
* Started 12OCT20
	* Began compiling resources, acquired our faculty mentors, and established our "draft goal" of what we seek to accomplish.
* 12OCT20 - 12APR21
	* Reviewed references, revised end-goal and project, and began discussing approach.
* 01SEP21
	* Began revision of project goals and meeting with team mentors.

# TTP'S

### What are TTP's?
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP's) represent how threat agents (the adversary) actually execute and manage their attacks. Specifically, "TTP's are patterns of activites or methods associated with a _specific_ threat actor or group of threat actors". In short, they categorize the attack by way of identifying the most probable actor, including related attacks, possible sources or vectors, what systems are most likely to be compromised, and how to defend against these known threat agent TTP's.

TTP's directly help to attribute to a foreign nation-state adversary, in addition to common vectors of attack, i.e emails with a zero-day exploit.

# Malware

### Our Focus
This capstone will primarily focus on ransomware. We will attempt to build a toolkit that is able to distinguish whether or not a file is malicious and categorized as a ransomware malware executable.
